# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
We have been tasked with doing a research project for the nonprofit foundation, AlphabetSoup. We will create a mathematical, data-driven solution to accurately predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- The target for our model was whether or not the fundraising campaign was successful.
- The features of our model were application type and classification.
- We removed EIN and Name from our dataset, as they are irrelevant for what we are trying to obtain.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- Evaluation of the model - Loss: 0.9950710535049438, Accuracy: 0.47591835260391235

## Summary
I struggle to understand neural networks and deep learning models, so I was unable to determine the overall results of the data learning model.
